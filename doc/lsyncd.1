.SH "DESCRTIPTION"
Lsyncd(1) watches a local directory trees event monitor interface (inotify)\&. It aggregates and combines events for a few seconds and then spawns one (or more) process(es) to synchronize the changes\&. By default this is rsync(1)\&. Lsyncd is thus a light\-weight live mirror solution that is comparatively easy to install not requiring new filesystems or blockdevices and does not hamper local filesystem performance\&.
.sp
Rsync+ssh is an advanced action configuration that uses a SSH(1) to act file and directory moves directly on the target instead of retransmitting the move destination over the wire\&.
.sp
Fine\-grained customizaton can be achieved through the CONFIG\-FILE\&. Custom action configs can even be written from scratch in cascading layers ranging from shell scripts to code written in the LUA(1) language\&. This way simplicity can be balanced with powerfulness\&. See the online manual for details on the CONFIG\-FILE http://code\&.google\&.com/p/lsyncd/wiki/Lsyncd20Manual
