.SH "NAME"
lsyncd.conf.xml \- xconfig file for lsyncd
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIlsyncd.conf.xml\fR
is used to configure the
\fBlsyncd\fR
daemon.
.PP
Note that any command line options can overrule settings in the config file. A
\fBlsyncd\fR
configuration file has an XML grammar. That means tags have to be closed with a / and the such. Following explanations will be provided with an examples.
.PP
The config file must start with a
\fB<lsyncd>\fR
root node. A "version" parameter has to be present which specifies the lsyncd version of the config file format. Currently this is 1.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
<lsyncd version="1">
.fi
.RE
.SS "SETTINGS"
.PP
Next is optionally a
\fB<settings>\fR
node. It controls lsyncd global settings. All settings are optional.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
  <settings>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<debug/>\fR
node is present all debug messages will be logged. Default is a normal verbosity.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <debug/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If
\fB<delay/>\fR
specified by the "value" parameter is greater than zero, lsyncd waits this amount of seconds between an event and calling the binary. All events for a directory in this timeframe will be aggregated to one call. If delay is 0 changes will be handlet immediatly. Default is 5 seconds.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <delay/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<scarce>\fR
node is present only error messages will be logged. Default is a normal verbosity.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <scarce/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<stubborn>\fR
node is present lsyncd will continue even if the startup sync fails. Default is being not stubborn.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <stubborn/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<no\-daemon>\fR
node is present lsyncd will not detach and log to stdout/stderr. Default is to detach as daemon.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <no\-daemon/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<no\-startup>\fR
node is present lsyncd will not initiate the recursive rsync call on startup. Not adviced, know what you are doing if using this.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <no\-startup/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<dry\-run>\fR
node is present lsyncd will not call any actions (rsync) for test purposes. Default is not to run dry.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <dry\-run/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
With an
\fB<exclude\-from>\fR
entry an exclusion file can be specified with a "filename" parameter. This will be passed to rsync and follows rsyncs grammar for exclude files. Default is not to pass an exlude file to rsync.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <exclude\-from filename="/etc/lsyncd.exclude"/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
With a
\fB<logfile>\fR
node to location of the logfile can be changed. Default is
\fI/var/log/lsyncd\fR. Take care that the user which lsyncd is running with can write to this file.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <logfile filename="/var/log/lsyncd"/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
A
\fB<binary>\fR
node specifies the binary lsyncd will call to sync stuff. Usually you want this to be rsync. Default is
\fI/usr/bin/rsync\fR.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <binary filename="/usr/bin/rsync"/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
If a
\fB<pidfile>\fR
node is present lsyncd will write its pid there. Default is not to write a pidfile.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <pidfile filename="/var/run/lsyncd.pid"/>
.fi
.RE
.PP
With a
\fB<callopts>\fR
node you can control the arguments lsyncd will call the <binary> (rsync) with. Each child node will specify one argument. <option> specifies a literal argument. Only %r will be replaced with 'r' when rsycnd is supposed to work recursive (on startup of lsyncd) or 'd' on normal operations. <exclude\-file> will be replaced with
\fB\-\-exclude\-from [FILE]\fR
if an <exclude\-from> file is specified. <source> will be replaced the source directory to sync from. <destination> will be replace to the target to sync to. Default arguments are
\fB\-lts%r \-\-delete {\-\-exclude\-from [FILE]} [SOURCE] [DIRECTORY]\fR.
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
    <callopts>
     .PP
With a
\fB<inotify>\fR
node you can control the inotify events lsyncd will register to. Each event is configured by a <event> child node and its attribute 'id'. The following events may be registered: ACCESS,ATTRIB,CLOSE_WRITE,CLOSE_NOWRITE,CREATE,DELETE,DELETE_SELF,MODIFY,MOVE_SELF,MOVED_FROM,MOVED_TO,OPEN. If the inotify node is omitted the following events are registered by default: IN_ATTRIB,IN_CLOSE_WRITE,IN_CREATE,IN_DELETE,IN_DELETE_SELF,IN_MOVED_FROM,IN_MOVED_TO,IN_DONT_FOLLOW,IN_ONLYDIR.

     
.sp
.RS 3n

    <inotify>
        <event id="MOVED_TO"/>
        <event id="DELETE"/>
    </inotify>

.SS "DIRECTORIES"

+      .PP
With
\fB<directory>\fR
nodes arbitrarily many sources to be watched can be specified. Within a <directory> entry you can again specify a
\fB<binary>\fR,
\fB<exclude\-from>\fR,
\fB<callopt>\fR
or a
\fB<inotify>\fR
node which will override global settings just for this source. See SETTINGS for details on this options.

+      .PP
The mandatory
\fB<source>\fR
node specifies with the paramater "path" the directory to watch and sync. (once in a while something is mandatory. Also at least one
\fB<target;>\fR
node has to specified where to sync to. This has to be a format accepted by rsync.
